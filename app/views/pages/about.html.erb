	<h4>Who are We</h4>
	Who is me actually. One guy. My name is <%= link_to("Joshua Dance", "https://twitter.com/joshdance") %>. 

	<h4>Backstory</h4>
	I created this site because I have a sister, and she really likes bunnies. I would email her pictures of cute bunnies every once in a while and it was hard to find them sometimes. Then I thought, what if I made a site where people could submit cute pictures? I could just send the cutest ones to her. Then I thought, how would I know which ones were cutest? 

	CuteFluffyBattle then leapt from my mind, in all itâ€™s cute glory and I decided to to make it a reality.
